Our largest model with 7.5 billion parameters sets new state of the art in few-shot learning on more than 20 representative languages, outperforming GPT-3 of comparable size in multilingual commonsense reasoning (+7.4 accuracy points for 0-shot, +9.4 for 4-shot) and natural language inference (+5.4 for 0-shot, +5.4 for 4-shot).
