XStoryCloze consists of the professionally translated version of the [English StoryCloze dataset](https://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/) (Spring 2016 version) to 10 non-English languages. This dataset is released by Meta AI.

# Languages
ru, zh (Simplified), es (Latin America), ar, hi, id, te, sw, eu, my.

# Data Splits
This dataset is intended to be used for evaluating the zero- and few-shot learning capabilities of multlingual language models. We split the data for each language into train and test (360 vs. 1510 examples, respectively). The released data files for different languages maintain a line-by-line alignment.

# Access English StoryCloze
Please request the original English StoryCloze dataset through the [official channel](https://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/). You can create a split of the en data following our data split scheme using the following commands:
```
head -361 spring2016.val.tsv > spring2016.val.en.tsv.split_20_80_train.tsv

head -1 spring2016.val.tsv > spring2016.val.en.tsv.split_20_80_eval.tsv
tail -1511 spring2016.val.tsv >> spring2016.val.en.tsv.split_20_80_eval.tsv
```
